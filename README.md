You can change radius, width of stroke, all of colors, font, persentage and animation duration of each diagram you created.
You can also put any diagram at any place of your page using css selectors.

All you need is to add javascript file to you html page

And create diagram using methods of Chart class. The class takes an object to it's contructor. This object is supposed to contain css and svg properties in order to customize your diagram. If you want to tune it using methods, you can leave the settings object empty.
